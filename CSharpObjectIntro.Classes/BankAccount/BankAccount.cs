        // As you complete each task make sure you test your code carefully
        // Choose some combination of manual testing, Debug.Assert and unit tests

        // Task One        
        // The bank account should have a balance property        
        // It should have a constructor that sets the initial balance (default zero) and the opening date (default today)
        // It should have methods to deposit and withdraw/make payments from the account. 

        // Task Two
        // Give the option to set an overdraft limit
        // Do not allow a withdrawal/payment if the overdraft limit is exceeded. You could return false or throw an exception.

        // Task Three
        // Create a new class called AccountTransaction.
        // It could contain properties such as
        // date, amount, category, counterparty, transactionType, description (optional)
        // e.g 26/09/2022 16:45, -300, Groceries, Waitrose, Card, Weekly shop
        //     27/09/2022 17:40, 200, Gift, Bob Smith, Cheque, Birthday present
        // You might wish to use enums for category and transactionType
        // Amend your bank account to contain a list of transactions
        // The methods for  deposit and withdraw/make payments should be amended to add transactions

        // Task Four
        // Now add some new methods to your account
        // - See what the balance was at a previous date
        // - See how much money was spent in a given time period
        // - See how much money was spent in different categories

        // Extension
        // Work out how much interest is payable on your account
        // For the moment make up the interest rates, though later we could look at loading them from a website
        // The interest should be added as transactions to your account
